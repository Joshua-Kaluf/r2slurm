\value{
A \code{slurm_job} object.
}
\description{
Constructs a Slurm job specification that can be rendered to an
sbatch script and submitted to a Slurm scheduler.
Validation is always performed when rendering or submitting a job.
Setting \code{validate = TRUE} performs an additional check at construction time.
}
\examples{
# Simple job
job1 <- slurm_job("echo Hello World", job_name = "hello", cpus = 2)

# Job with memory, walltime, and partition
job2 <- slurm_job(
  body = c("module load python", "python script.py"),
  job_name = "python_job",
  partition = "short",
  time = "01:00:00",
  mem = "4G",
  cpus = 2
)

# Validation at creation
\dontrun{
job3 <- slurm_job("echo Validate Me", validate = TRUE)
}
